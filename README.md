Simple 27 MHz halo antenna
For a halo (or loop) antenna designed for 27.5 MHz and a square shape, you can follow these steps to determine its dimensions, bandwidth, and SWR limits.

    Calculate the wavelength (λ) for 27.5 MHz:

λ = c / f
where
c = speed of light (approximately 300,000,000 meters per second)
f = frequency (27.5 MHz, or 27,500,000 Hz)

λ = 300,000,000 / 27,500,000 ≈ 10.91 meters

    Determine the dimensions of the square loop:

For a full-wavelength loop, the perimeter should be approximately equal to the wavelength. Since the loop is square, you can divide the wavelength by 4 to get the length of each side.

Side length = λ / 4 ≈ 10.91 / 4 ≈ 2.73 meters

So, each side of the square loop should be approximately 2.73 meters long.
